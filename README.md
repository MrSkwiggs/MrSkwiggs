# 👋 Hi there, I’m Skwiggs


## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior iOS & Swift Engineer based in the Netherlands with over 10 years of experience crafting high-performance, user-centric apps. My passion for Swift runs deep (ask me about my Swift tattoo!) and I love applying its full power from SwiftUI UIs to Vapor backends, scripting, and beyond. I'm always curious and always learning.


## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

Here are a few of my favorite technologies and tools:

- **Core**: Swift (Structured Concurrency, Reactive patterns)  
- **iOS**: SwiftUI · AVFoundation · Combine · XCTest · XCUITests · Swift Testing  
- **Beyond iOS**:  
  - Shell scripting with [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser)  
  - Back-end with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)  
  - Web with [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite)  

## 📝 Projects

### StreamCam
I'm the author of [StreamCam](https://www.streamcam.app/), a self-published iOS app that turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam for Mac, PC, or Linux. It supports low-latency streaming and works out of the box with apps like OBS and Twitch Studio.

### RocketSim Insights
I'm freelancing for Antoine van der Lee, contributing to [RocketSim Insights](https://www.rocketsim.app/team-insights/) with Vapor-based backend work.

### ServerSide.swift Lightning Talk
I gave a short talk about "Running Vapor on iOS" at [ServerSide.swift London 2022](https://www.serversideswift.info/2022/schedule/). You can find the demo project I presented here: [Github](https://github.com/MrSkwiggs/ServerSide-Swift-Project)
