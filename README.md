# 👋 Hi there, I’m Dorian, but you can call me Skwiggs


## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior iOS & Swift Engineer based in the Netherlands with over 10 years of experience crafting high-performance, user-centric apps. My passion for Swift runs deep (ask me about my Swift tattoo!) and I love applying its full power from SwiftUI UIs to Vapor backends, scripting, and beyond. I'm always curious and always learning.


## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- **Core**: Swift (Structured Concurrency, Reactive patterns)  
- **iOS**: SwiftUI · AVFoundation · Combine · XCTest · XCUITests · Swift Testing  
- **Beyond iOS**:  
  - Shell scripting with [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser)  
  - Back-end with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)  
  - Web with [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite)
